## Description

As a new developer, I decided to embark on a project in Node.js to create SVG files representing simple shapes. It turned out to be an incredibly beneficial experience for my learning journey.

By diving into Node.js, I gained a deeper understanding of server-side JavaScript programming. I learned how to manipulate files, manage modules, and render SVG graphics. It was exciting to explore the vast ecosystem surrounding Node.js, discovering libraries like Express or Fastify for server creation, and the powerful SVG.js library for generating SVG elements.

Working on this project allowed me to strengthen my JavaScript skills, grasping important concepts like syntax, data structures, and control flow. It served as an excellent foundation for my future web development endeavors.

Overall, building this Node.js project provided me with invaluable hands-on experience, boosting my confidence and paving the way for more complex web applications.
